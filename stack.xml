  <description brief="plugins">
    The plugins package is a low-level, ROS-independent library that provides the ability to load/unload plugins. Plugins are classes that can be loaded from a runtime (dynamically-linked) library without having the declarations (i.e. header files) for the plugins, but rather just an interface (i.e. plugin base class) declaration.
